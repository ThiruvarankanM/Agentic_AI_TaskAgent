# Langgraph_demo
A lightweight, modular LLM agent framework built using LangGraph, powered by Groq's ultra-fast LLaMA3-8B model. This project demonstrates how to create a goal-oriented agent that breaks down a user prompt into sub-tasks, executes each one using LLM reasoning, and summarizes the outcome â€” all within a structured graph-based flow.
